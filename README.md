# West Java Poverty Visualization

This case challenged me to analyze some factor of poverty in West Java, Indonesia, then gave a solution. My friends and I have made a basic analysis and data preprocessing using Microsoft Excel and Python. Then, we found 3 solutions to cover this problem, which are support local creative industry, maximize the export potential of traditional culinary, and improve the quality of education. Since there are tons of data, I have also visualized it using Tableau

Fun fact, this is my first project and competition that I have joined in my first year as Data Science student in Airlangga University, and this interactive dashboard helped my team to become the Best Presentation Team & Top 5 National of *Turnamen Sains Data Nasional* that held by Cybertrend Data Academy x Shopee. At last, feel free to give me some feedbacks. I really need it to improve my skill on data visualization. Cheers!
